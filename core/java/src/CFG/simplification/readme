package that contains classes to simplify a CFG according to its last node which
the postcondition of the program.

All nodes whose variables do not depend from the variables of the postcondition are removed.

Usefull variables which have been collected are stored in the cfg. These useful variables can be used 
to generate variables for the concrete solvers.
