Loops are unwound 10 times.

From the counterexample, LocFaults calculates MCS by exploring the graph in DFS from top to bottom and by deviating at most '2' conditional statements.
Solver: CPLEX
/***************************************************************/
By deviating '0' condition(s), we obtain:

1. CSP_d: empty set
------------------------
2. CSP_a:
mid_0_a_0 := 2 --> line -1
mid_0_b_0 := 1 --> line -1
mid_0_c_0 := 3 --> line -1
mid_0_m_0 := 0 --> line 12
mid_0_m_1 := mid_0_c_0 --> line 13
mid_0_m_2 := mid_0_b_0 --> line 19
( ( mid_0_m_2 == 2 ) ) --> line -2

The system is infeasible
